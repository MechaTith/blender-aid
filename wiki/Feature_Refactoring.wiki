#Refactoring is the ability to change existing structures

= Introduction =

Blender is a great tool, but is content centric file-based tool. Libraries are loaded read-only and only a single file can be changed at a time. Due to this it is hard to rename object and files. Why? nowhere within blender you can view where your object is used or referenced.

= Details =

the next refactoring will be supported by this tool:

 * rename a file
 * rename an element within a blender-file
 * move a file to another location
 * move an element from blender-file1 to blender-file2
 * repair missing links
 * update render settings
