#labels Phase-Design
There are 3 kind of blend files.
 # uncompressed blend files
 # compressed blend files
 # packed blend files.

compressed blend files are GZ variants of the uncompressed version. These files are commonly used to reduce needed space for Source control.

Within blender you can change this by File ==> Compressed

= Compress files =
This feature will find all not compressed blend files
and make tasks to compress them

= Functional questions =
== Is there somewhere inside the blender data model a place where this is administered? ==
during first inspection this has not been found.
== or is it only determined by the type of file what has been read? ==

= Technical questions =
== Where is compression stored? ==
when compressing a blend file by hand, the file is read correctely, but in the menu the file is not marked as compressed. I assume that somewhere in the model, an attribute tells blender if the file was originally compressed.


= Impact = 
 * blendfile.py ==> add write int method
 * production.html ==> add UI to start compression
 * servicerefactoring.py ==> add logic to do the refactoring
 * indexer.py ==> selector to find all uncompressed files
 * update user manual
 * update web site
 * create testcase
