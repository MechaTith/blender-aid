#labels Phase-Design
There are 3 kind of blend files.
# uncompressed blend files
# compressed blend files
# packed blend files.

compressed blend files are GZ variants of the uncompressed version. These files are commonly used to reduce needed space for Source control.

Within blender you can change this by File ==> Compressed

= Compress files =
This feature will find all not compressed blend files
and make tasks to compress them

= Functional questions =
Is there somewhere inside the blender data model a place where this is administered?
or is it only determined by the type of file what has been read?

= Impact = 
 * production.html ==> add logic to start compression
 * servicerefactoring.py ==> add logic to do the refactoring
 * update user manual
 * update web site
 * create testcase
