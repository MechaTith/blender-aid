#How to install the system

= Introduction =

This page describe the installation steps of the product

= INSTALL = 

just unzip the downloaded file (where this file is part of) and extract it to a directory
make sure the user has read & write priviledges to "/var/tmp".
and run server.py

python server.py

the migration tool can be started using

python migrate.py

= CONFIGURATION =

in settings.py settings can be modified. At this moment only the web server bingin (listening port) and the database location can be configured. Defaults are OK for local usage. When installing on a central server the web server binding needs to be altered to the networkcard in stead of the localhost.

Before using the migrate tool, a production has to be added. this can be done by starting the server. navigate with your browser to the server and add a production (in productions.html). After this is done, the migrate tool also knowns the production.

= DEPENDANCIES =

 * PIL (Python Image Library)
 * Python 2.6


= DE-INSTALLATION =

To remove just delete the directory where it is installed to. The only created file is /var/tmp/sql.bin (or otherwise when changed in settings.py)


= KNOWN ISSUES =

 * at this moment does only support Linux and Mac OS running 
 * at this moment PIL does not support Python3, so were stuck using Python2 at the moment. 


= CREDITS =

 * ... for the icons
 * Monique Dewanchand and Jeroen Bakker of At Mind for all other development
